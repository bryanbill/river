# RiverQL Reference

RiverQL is a universal query language for interacting with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, and SQL Server through a single, consistent syntax. Write once, query anywhere.

---

## Query Basics

### SELECT — `find`

Every query begins with `find`. It retrieves rows from a table.

```sql
find users
```

This is equivalent to `SELECT * FROM users`.

### Column Selection

Use square brackets to specify columns:

```sql
find [name, email] from users
```

Combine column selection with filters:

```sql
find [name, email, department] from users
where status = "active"
```

### Filtering — `where`

Filter rows with conditions:

```sql
find users where status = "active"
```

Chain conditions with `and` / `or`:

```sql
find users where status = "active" and age > 21
```

### Limiting Results — `limit`

Control the number of rows returned:

```sql
find users limit 10
```

Combined with a filter:

```sql
find [name, email] from users
where department = "Engineering"
limit 25
```

### Sorting — `order by`

Sort results:

```sql
find [name, salary] from users
order by salary desc
```

Multiple sort keys:

```sql
find [name, department, salary] from employees
order by department asc, salary desc
```

### Pagination — `limit` and `offset`

Page through results:

```sql
find [name, email] from users
order by created_at desc
limit 20 offset 40
```

This skips the first 40 rows and returns the next 20.

### Combined Query

Clause order: `find` -> `from` -> `where` -> `order by` -> `limit` -> `offset`

```sql
find [name, email, department, salary] from users
where status = "active" and salary > 50000
order by salary desc
limit 10
```

---

## Expressions and Operators

### Comparison Operators

```sql
find users where age > 21
find users where salary >= 75000
find users where status != "banned"
find products where price < 100
find orders where total <= 50.00
```

The `<>` operator is equivalent to `!=`:

```sql
find users where status <> "inactive"
```

### Logical Operators

Chain conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`:

```sql
find users where status = "active" and department = "Engineering"
find users where department = "Sales" or department = "Marketing"
find users where not status = "banned"
```

Parentheses control precedence:

```sql
find users
where (department = "Sales" or department = "Marketing")
  and salary > 60000
```

### NULL Handling

Test for NULL values with `is null` and `is not null`:

```sql
find users where deleted_at is null
find users where email_verified_at is not null
```

`coalesce` — returns the first non-null value:

```sql
find [name, coalesce(nickname, name) as display_name] from users
```

`nullif` — returns NULL if two values are equal (useful for avoiding division by zero):

```sql
find [name, nullif(discount, 0) as effective_discount] from products
```

`ifnull` — alias for a two-argument coalesce:

```sql
find [name, ifnull(phone, "N/A") as contact] from users
```

### BETWEEN

Test whether a value falls within an inclusive range:

```sql
find [name, created_at] from users
where created_at between "2024-01-01" and "2024-12-31"
```

```sql
find products where price between 10 and 50
```

### IN / NOT IN

Test membership in a list:

```sql
find users where status in ("active", "pending")
find users where department not in ("HR", "Legal")
```

`IN` also supports subqueries (see the Subqueries section).

### Pattern Matching — LIKE / ILIKE

- `%` matches any number of characters
- `_` matches exactly one character

```sql
find users where name like "%smith%"
find users where email like "%@gmail.com"
find users where name like "J_n"
```

`ilike` is the case-insensitive variant:

```sql
find users where name ilike "%smith%"
```

### Arithmetic

Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo)

```sql
find [name, price * 1.1 as price_with_tax] from products
find [name, salary] from employees where salary * 12 > 100000
```

### String Concatenation

Use `||` to concatenate strings:

```sql
find [first || " " || last as full_name] from users
```

### Type Casting

Two equivalent syntaxes:

```sql
-- Function style
find [name, cast(age as string) as age_str] from users

-- Operator style (:: shorthand)
find [name, created_at::string as date_str] from users
```

Supported target types: `string`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `datetime`, `json`

### Interval Literals

Interval literals for relative time calculations:

```sql
find users where created_at > now() - 30d
find users where created_at > now() - 1h
find users where last_login < now() - 90d
```

| Suffix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `y`    | Years   |
| `mon`  | Months  |
| `w`    | Weeks   |
| `d`    | Days    |
| `h`    | Hours   |
| `m`    | Minutes |
| `s`    | Seconds |

Date functions:

```sql
find [date_trunc("month", created_at) as month, count(*)] from users
group by month

find [extract(year from created_at) as yr] from users
```

### Built-in Functions

String functions:

```sql
find [upper(name), lower(email)] from users
find [concat(first, " ", last) as full_name] from users
find [length(name) as name_len] from users
```

Math functions:

```sql
find [abs(amount), round(price, 2), ceil(score), floor(score)] from products
find [power(population, 2) as pop_sq] from cities
find [sqrt(variance) as stddev] from stats
```

### Named Parameters

Define reusable parameters for templated queries:

```sql
:start_date = "2024-01-01"
:end_date = "2024-12-31"

find [name, total, created_at] from orders
where created_at between :start_date and :end_date
```

---

## Joins

Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

### Inner Join

An inner join returns only rows that have matching values in both tables. `join` is shorthand for `inner join`.

```sql
find [u.name, o.total]
from users as u
join orders as o on u.id = o.user_id
```

### Left Join

Returns all rows from the left table, with matched rows from the right (or NULL if no match):

```sql
find [u.name, o.total]
from users as u
left join orders as o on u.id = o.user_id
```

### Right Join

Returns all rows from the right table, with matched rows from the left:

```sql
find [u.name, o.total]
from users as u
right join orders as o on u.id = o.user_id
```

### Full Join

Returns all rows from both tables, with NULLs where there is no match on either side:

```sql
find [u.name, o.total]
from users as u
full join orders as o on u.id = o.user_id
```

### Cross Join

Returns the cartesian product of both tables. No `ON` clause is needed. Use with caution on large tables.

```sql
find [u.name, p.name as product]
from users as u
cross join products as p
limit 100
```

### Multiple Joins

Chain joins to combine three or more tables:

```sql
find [u.name, o.total, p.name as product]
from users as u
join orders as o on u.id = o.user_id
join order_items as oi on o.id = oi.order_id
join products as p on oi.product_id = p.id
```

### Self Join

Join a table to itself using different aliases:

```sql
find [e.name, m.name as manager]
from employees as e
left join employees as m on e.manager_id = m.id
```

### Table Aliases

The `as` keyword assigns a short alias to a table. Required when the same table appears multiple times, and useful for readability:

```sql
find [u.name, u.email]
from users as u
where u.status = "active"
```

### Joins with Filters

Combine joins with `where`:

```sql
find [u.name, o.total, o.status]
from users as u
join orders as o on u.id = o.user_id
where o.status = "paid" and o.total > 100
order by o.total desc
limit 20
```

### Qualified Column References

When columns have the same name in multiple tables, use `table.column` syntax:

```sql
find [u.name, o.status, p.name]
from users as u
join orders as o on u.id = o.user_id
join products as p on o.product_id = p.id
where u.status = "active"
```

## Aggregation

Aggregate functions compute a single value from a set of rows.

| Function              | Description                  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| `count(*)`            | Count all rows               |
| `count(expr)`         | Count non-NULL values        |
| `count_distinct(expr)`| Count distinct non-NULL values |
| `sum(expr)`           | Sum of values                |
| `avg(expr)`           | Average (mean)               |
| `min(expr)`           | Minimum value                |
| `max(expr)`           | Maximum value                |

```sql
find [count(*)] from users
find [sum(total)] from orders
find [avg(salary)] from employees
find [min(price), max(price)] from products
```

### Multiple Aggregates

```sql
find [
  count(*) as total_orders,
  sum(total) as revenue,
  avg(total) as avg_order,
  min(total) as smallest,
  max(total) as largest
]
from orders
where status = "paid"
```

### GROUP BY

Group rows by one or more columns, then apply aggregates to each group:

```sql
find [department, count(*) as headcount]
from employees
group by department
```

Multiple grouping columns:

```sql
find [department, status, count(*) as cnt]
from employees
group by department, status
```

### GROUP BY with Full Projection

```sql
find [
  category,
  count(*) as product_count,
  avg(price) as avg_price,
  min(price) as cheapest,
  max(price) as most_expensive
]
from products
group by category
order by product_count desc
```

### HAVING

Filter groups after aggregation (unlike `where`, which filters rows before aggregation):

```sql
find [user_id, count(*) as order_count]
from orders
group by user_id
having count(*) > 5
```

### WHERE vs. HAVING

- `where` — filters individual rows before grouping
- `having` — filters groups after aggregation

```sql
find [department, avg(salary) as avg_sal]
from employees
where status = "active"
group by department
having avg(salary) > 75000
```

### Multiple HAVING Conditions

```sql
find [department, count(*) as cnt, avg(salary) as avg_sal]
from employees
group by department
having cnt > 3 and avg_sal > 50000
```

### COUNT DISTINCT

Count unique values in a column:

```sql
find [
  status,
  count(*) as total_orders,
  count_distinct(user_id) as unique_customers
]
from orders
group by status
```

### Aggregation with Joins

```sql
find [u.name, count(*) as order_count, sum(o.total) as total_spent]
 from users as u
 join orders as o on u.id = o.user_id
 where o.status = "paid"
 group by u.name
 having total_spent > 1000
 order by total_spent desc
 limit 10
```

---

## Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without collapsing rows.

### Window Syntax

```sql
function() over (partition by col order by col)
```

- `partition by` — divide rows into groups (like GROUP BY, but rows are preserved)
- `order by` — define the order within each partition

### ROW_NUMBER

Assigns a sequential number to each row within a partition:

```sql
find [
  name,
  department,
  salary,
  row_number() over (partition by department order by salary desc) as rank
]
from employees
```

### RANK and DENSE_RANK

`rank()` — rows with equal values get the same rank, with gaps:

```sql
find [
  name,
  score,
  rank() over (order by score desc) as position
]
from players
```

If two players tie for 1st, the next player is 3rd (gap at 2nd).

`dense_rank()` — same, but no gaps:

```sql
find [
  name,
  score,
  dense_rank() over (order by score desc) as position
]
from players
```

If two players tie for 1st, the next player is 2nd (no gap).

### LAG and LEAD

Access values from previous or next rows:

```sql
find [
  date,
  revenue,
  lag(revenue, 1) over (order by date) as prev_day,
  lead(revenue, 1) over (order by date) as next_day
]
from daily_stats
```

- `lag(expr, N)` — value from N rows before
- `lead(expr, N)` — value from N rows after

Day-over-day change:

```sql
find [
  date,
  revenue,
  revenue - lag(revenue, 1) over (order by date) as daily_change
]
from daily_stats
```

### Running Totals

Use `sum()` as a window function:

```sql
find [
  date,
  amount,
  sum(amount) over (order by date) as running_total
]
from transactions
```

### Aggregates Over Windows

Any aggregate function can be used as a window function:

```sql
find [
  name,
  department,
  salary,
  avg(salary) over (partition by department) as dept_avg,
  salary - avg(salary) over (partition by department) as diff_from_avg
]
from employees
```

### Named Windows

Define a window specification once with `window`:

```sql
find [
  name,
  department,
  salary,
  avg(salary) over w as dept_avg,
  max(salary) over w as dept_max,
  min(salary) over w as dept_min
]
from employees
window w as (partition by department)
```

### Window Function Examples

**Top N Per Group** — top 3 highest-paid employees per department:

```sql
find * from (
  find [
    name,
    department,
    salary,
    row_number() over (partition by department order by salary desc) as rn
  ]
  from employees
) as ranked
where rn <= 3
```

**Percentage of Total:**

```sql
find [
  category,
  sum(total) as cat_revenue,
  sum(total) * 100.0 / sum(sum(total)) over () as pct_of_total
]
from orders
join products on orders.product_id = products.id
group by category
```

**Moving Average:**

```sql
find [
  date,
  revenue,
  avg(revenue) over (order by date) as cumulative_avg
]
from daily_stats
```

---

## Advanced Queries

### CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Define temporary named result sets for use later in the query.

```sql
with active_users as (
  find * from users where status = "active"
)
find [name, email] from active_users
```

#### Multiple CTEs

Chain CTEs with commas:

```sql
with
  paid_orders as (
    find * from orders where status = "paid"
  ),
  user_totals as (
    find [user_id, sum(total) as revenue]
    from paid_orders
    group by user_id
  )
 find [u.name, ut.revenue]
 from users as u
 join user_totals as ut on u.id = ut.user_id
 where ut.revenue > 10
 order by ut.revenue desc
```

#### Recursive CTEs

For hierarchical data (org charts, category trees, etc.):

```sql
with recursive org_tree as (
  find * from employees where manager_id is null
  union all
  find [e.*]
  from employees as e
  join org_tree as t on e.manager_id = t.id
)
find * from org_tree
```

The first query is the base case; the `union all` query references the CTE itself to recurse.

### Subqueries

#### Scalar Subquery in WHERE

```sql
find [name, salary]
 from users
 where salary > (
  find [avg(salary)] from users
)
```

#### IN Subquery

```sql
find [name, department]
 from employees
where department in (
  find distinct [department] from departments
  where budget > 100000
)
```

#### NOT IN Subquery

```sql
find [name] from users
 where id not in (
  find distinct [user_id] from orders
  where created_at > now() - 365d
)
```

#### EXISTS / NOT EXISTS

```sql
find [name] from users as u
where exists (
  find [1] from orders as o where o.user_id = u.id
)
```

Find users with no orders:

```sql
find [name] from users as u
 where not exists (
  find [1] from orders as o where o.user_id = u.id
)
```

#### Scalar Subquery in SELECT

```sql
find [
  name,
  (find [count(*)] from orders where orders.user_id = users.id) as order_count
]

from users
```

#### Subquery in FROM (Derived Table)

```sql
find * from (
  find [user_id, sum(total) as revenue]
  from orders
  group by user_id
) as user_revenue
where revenue > 500
```

### Set Operations

#### UNION

```sql
find [name, email] from customers
union
find [name, email] from suppliers
```

#### UNION ALL

```sql
find [name, email] from customers
union all
find [name, email] from suppliers
```

#### INTERSECT

```sql
find [user_id] from orders where year = 2024
intersect
find [user_id] from orders where year = 2025
```

#### EXCEPT

```sql
find [user_id] from users
except
find [user_id] from orders where created_at > now() - 30d
```

### CASE Expressions

#### Searched CASE

```sql
find [
  name,
  salary,
  case
    when salary < 50000 then "Low"
    when salary >= 50000 and salary < 100000 then "Medium"
    when salary >= 100000 then "High"
    else "Unknown"
  end as salary_band
]

from users
```

#### Simple CASE

```sql
find [
  name,
  case status
    when "active" then "Active User"
    when "suspended" then "Suspended"
    else "Unknown"
  end as status_label
]

from users
```

#### CASE in ORDER BY

```sql
find [name, priority] from tasks
order by case priority
  when "urgent" then 1
  when "high" then 2
  when "normal" then 3
  else 4
end
```

#### CASE in WHERE

```sql
find [name, total] from orders
where case
  when user_id in (find [id] from vip_users) then total > 50
  else total > 100
end
```

### DISTINCT

Remove duplicate rows:

```sql
find distinct [department] from employees
find distinct [status] from orders
```

### EXPLAIN

View the query plan without executing:

```sql
explain find [name] from users
join orders on users.id = orders.user_id
```

---

## Schema-Qualified Tables

Prefix a table name with `schema.` to query tables in a specific database schema:

```sql
find * from public.users
```

When omitted, the connection's `schema` (configured in `river.yaml`) or the database-native default (e.g., `public` for Postgres) is used.

Combine with a connection reference:

```sql
find [name, email] from myschema.users@pg
```

Schema qualification works across all statement types:

```sql
describe public.users
describe inventory.products@pg
show tables @pg
create public.users { name: "Alice" }
update sales.orders@pg set status = "shipped" where id = 1
remove archive.logs@mongo where created_at < now() - 30d
```

For Postgres, MySQL, and MSSQL, `describe` filters by both table name and schema, avoiding ambiguity when the same table name exists in multiple schemas. SQLite ignores the schema prefix (SQLite has no schemas).

---

## Cross-Database Queries

River can query across different database systems in a single statement. Use `@connection-name` to specify which database a table lives in.

### Connection References

Append `@connection` to any table name:

```sql
find [name, email] from users@pg
```

### Cross-Database Joins

```sql
find [u.name, o.total]
 from users@pg as u
 join orders@mysql as o on u.id = o.user_id
 where o.status = "paid"
```

River fetches data from each source independently, performs the join, then applies filters and projections.

### Cross-Database CTEs

```sql
with
  pg_users as (
    find [id, name] from users@pg
    where status = "active"
  ),
  mongo_logs as (
    find [user_id, action, timestamp]
    from logs@mongo
    where timestamp > now() - 7d
  )
 find [pg_users.name, count(*) as login_count]
 from pg_users
 join mongo_logs on pg_users.id = mongo_logs.user_id
 where mongo_logs.action = "login"
 group by pg_users.name
 order by login_count desc
 limit 10
```

### Connection Configuration

Connections are defined in `river.yaml`:

NOTE: Avoid using `-` in connection names

```yaml
- name: pg
  kind: postgres
  uri: "postgres://river:river@localhost:5432/river"
  schema: public

- name: mysql
  kind: mysql
  uri: "mysql://river:river@localhost:3306/river"
  schema: river

- name: mongo
  kind: mongodb
  uri: "mongodb://localhost:27017"

- name: sqlite
  kind: sqlite
  uri: "sqlite:river.db?mode=rwc"
```

### Meta Commands with Connections

Describe a remote table:

```sql
describe users@pg
```

List tables on a connection:

```sql
show tables @pg
show tables @mysql
```

### Performance Guidance

Cross-database joins fetch data from each source, then join locally. Recommendations:

- Push filters down with `where` before the join to reduce transferred rows
- Use CTEs or subqueries with `limit` to cap what is fetched
- Ensure join columns are indexed on both sides

Efficient pattern:

```sql
with
  recent_orders as (
    find [user_id, total] from orders@pg
    where created_at > now() - 7d
    limit 1000
  )
find [u.name, ro.total]
from users@mysql as u
join recent_orders as ro on u.id = ro.user_id
```

Inefficient pattern (avoid):

```sql
-- Fetches ALL orders and ALL users before joining
find [u.name, o.total]
from users@mysql as u
join orders@pg as o on u.id = o.user_id
```

---

## Data Modification

### INSERT — `create`

Single row (object syntax):

```sql
create users { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com", age: 30 }
```

Multiple rows (array syntax):

```sql
create users [
  { name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" },
  { name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com" },
  { name: "Carol", email: "carol@example.com" }
]
```

Insert from query:

```sql
create active_users_backup (
  find * from users where status = "active"
)
```

Insert to a specific connection:

```sql
create users@pg { name: "Dave", email: "dave@example.com" }
```

### UPDATE

Modify existing rows with `update ... set ... where`:

```sql
update users
set status = "inactive", updated_at = now()
where last_login < now() - 90d
```

Update with expressions:

```sql
update products
set price = price * 1.1
where category = "premium"
```

Update on a specific connection:

```sql
update users@pg
set status = "verified"
where email_verified_at is not null
```

Without a `where` clause, the update applies to all rows. Always use `where` unless you intend a full-table update.

### DELETE — `remove`

```sql
remove users where status = "banned"
```

Delete with subquery:

```sql
remove users
where id not in (
  find distinct [user_id] from orders
  where created_at > now() - 365d
)
```

Delete on a specific connection:

```sql
remove logs@mongo
where timestamp < now() - 30d
```

Without `where`, all rows are deleted. Always use `where` unless you intend a full-table deletion.

|-----------|---------------------|
| String    | `"hello"`           |
| Integer   | `42`                |
| Float     | `3.14`              |

### Interval Suffixes

| Suffix | Unit   |
|--------|--------|
| `y`    | Year   |

### Aggregate Functions

```
count(*), count(expr), count_distinct(expr)
sum(expr), avg(expr), min(expr), max(expr)
```

### Window Functions

```
row_number() over (...)
rank() over (...)
dense_rank() over (...)
lag(expr, N) over (...)
lead(expr, N) over (...)
first_value(expr) over (...)
last_value(expr) over (...)
nth_value(expr, N) over (...)
```

Any aggregate can also be used as a window function:

```
sum(expr) over (...)
avg(expr) over (...)
```

### Built-in Functions

| Category    | Functions                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| String      | `upper()`, `lower()`, `concat()`, `length()`   |
| Math        | `abs()`, `round()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, `power()`, `sqrt()` |
| Date/Time   | `now()`, `date_trunc()`, `extract()`           |
| Null Handling | `coalesce()`, `nullif()`, `ifnull()`         |
| Type        | `cast(expr as type)`                           |

### Data Types (for CAST)

`string`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `datetime`, `json`

### Data Modification

```sql
-- Insert one
create table { col: value, ... }

-- Insert many
create table [{ ... }, { ... }]

-- Insert from query
create table (find ...)

-- Update
update table set col = value where ...

-- Delete
remove table where ...
```

### Cross-Database

```sql
-- Query a specific connection
find * from users@prod-pg

-- Join across databases
find [u.name, o.total]
from users@prod-pg as u
join orders@analytics-mysql as o on u.id = o.user_id
```

### Meta Commands

```sql
describe table[@connection]
show tables [@connection]
explain find ...
:param = value
```

## Cardinal Rules

1. Every query starts with `find`
2. Clause order: `find` -> `from` -> `where` -> `group by` -> `having` -> `order by` -> `limit` -> `offset`
3. Always use `where` with `update` and `remove`
4. The `@connection` suffix enables cross-database queries
5. Use `explain` before executing expensive queries
